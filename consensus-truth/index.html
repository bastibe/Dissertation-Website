      <h1>Fundamental Frequency Ground Truth for Speech Corpora from Multi-Algorithm Consensus</h1>
    </header>

      <p class="abstract">The fundamental frequency of the human voice is an
      essential feature for various speech processing tasks such as speech
      recognition, speaker identification, and speech compression. Therefore, a
      large number of fundamental frequency estimation algorithms have been
      developed. To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, their
      estimates are often compared against a known ground truth fundamental
      frequency, typically derived from laryngograph recordings. However,
      laryngograph recordings are not available for all kinds of speech corpora,
      and can be tonal where the acoustic speech signal is not. Alternatively,
      fundamental frequency estimates of speech in noise are compared against
      clean speech estimates of a reference algorithm. While this works for
      arbitrary speech recordings, it is highly dependent on the reference
      algorithm. We therefore propose a new method for deriving a fundmental
      frequency ground truth from the consensus of a number of state-of-the-art
      fundamental frequency estimation algorithms, which can be calculated for
      any speech corpus, is more robust than a single algorithm's estimate, and
      which better reflects the acoustic tonality of speech.</p>

        This website contains the new consensus ground truth data as
        structured <a href="https://jbof.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">JBOF
        datasets</a> datasets, as well as scripts for importing the original
        datasets as JBOF datasets, and those imported datasets, for the
        following five speech corpora:

        The import scripts are: (1) a shell script for downloading the corpora
        from their original websites, and (2) a Python script for reading that
        data and importing it into a JBOF dataset. JBOF datasets are a simple
        file/directory structure for binary data and metadata that is easily
        accessible both using a file explorer, and a programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Source code for reading JBOF datasets in Python or Matlab is provided
        under a free license on
        <a href="https://github.com/bastibe/jbof">Github</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        No complete dataset can be provided for the TIMIT corpus, since its
        license does not allow for it. Full datasets are currently hosted on an
        OwnCloud instance, with the password "consensus". A better solution is
        actively being working on.
