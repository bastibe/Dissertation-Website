      <h1>Fundamental Frequency Ground Truth for Speech Corpora from Multi-Algorithm Consensus</h1>

      <article>
        <p class="abstract">The fundamental frequency of the human voice is an
          essential feature for various speech processing tasks such as speech
          recognition, speaker identification, and speech compression. Therefore, a
          large number of fundamental frequency estimation algorithms have been
          developed. To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, their
          estimates are often compared against a known ground truth fundamental
          frequency, typically derived from laryngograph recordings. However,
          laryngograph recordings are not available for all kinds of speech corpora,
          and can be tonal where the acoustic speech signal is not. Alternatively,
          fundamental frequency estimates of speech in noise are compared against
          clean speech estimates of a reference algorithm. While this works for
          arbitrary speech recordings, it is highly dependent on the reference
          algorithm. We therefore propose a new method for deriving a fundmental
          frequency ground truth from the consensus of a number of state-of-the-art
          fundamental frequency estimation algorithms, which can be calculated for
          any speech corpus, is more robust than a single algorithm's estimate, and
          which better reflects the acoustic tonality of speech.</p>
